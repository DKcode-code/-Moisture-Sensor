# ASU West Valley Garden Monitoring 

![West Valley Gardens Logo](./assets/west-valley-gardens-logo-halfsize.svg)

This contains prototyped code for the West Valley Garden Monitoring Sensors using a Arudino R4 WIFI. We measure Moisture, Tempreature, and NPK readings.

This project is designed to upload data directly into a Google Sheet to allow easy consupmtion and graphing of data collected, you can find the spreadsheet here.

[WILL BE UPDATED WHEN SPREADSHEET IS CREATED](https://google.com)

# How to Build / Upload
You can use any arudino build tool like the IDE. Arduino-cli is reccomened since it makes installing everything very easy to setup.

- Follow the instructions to download and [install arudino-cli](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/installation/#download).
- Run these commands in a terminal: 
```sh
arduino-cli core update-index # Update Index
arduino-cli core install arduino:renesas_uno # Install R4 Wifi board
arduino-cli lib install ArduinoJson # Install JSON support
arduino-cli lib install ArduinoHttpClient # Install Http support
```
- Now to build open a shell in the root of this project and run: 
```sh
arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:renesas_uno:unor4wifi . 
```
- Uploading tutorial will come when we have the real board to test on...
